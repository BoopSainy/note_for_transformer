abstract:
predicting fetal weight at birth is an important aspect of perinatal care, particularly in the context of antenatal
management, which includes the planned timing and the mode of delivery. Accurate prediction of weight using prenatal
ultrasound is challenging as it requires images of specific fetal body parts during advanced pregnancy which is 
difficult to capture due to poor quality of images caused by the lack of amniotic fuild. As a consequence, predictions 
which rely on standard methods often suffer from significant errors. in this paper we proose the residual transformer
module which extends a 3d resnet-based network for analysis of 2d+t spatiotemporal ultrasound video scans. our 
end-to-end method, called babynet, automatically predicts fetal birth weight based on fetal ultrasound video scans.
we evaluate babynet using a dedicated clinical set comprising 225 2d fetal ultrasound videos of pregnancies from 
75 patients performed one day piror to delivery. experimental results show that babynet outperforms several
state-of-the-art methods and estimates the weight at birth with accrauct comparable to human experts. furthermore,
combining estimates provided by human experts with those computed by babynet yields the best results, outperforming
either of other methods by a significant margin. the source code ...
