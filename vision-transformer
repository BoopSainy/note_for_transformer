in this tutorial, we will take a closer look at a recent new trend: transformers for computer vision
since Alexey D et al. successfully applied a transformer on a variety of image recognition benchmarks,
there have been an incredible amount of follow-up works showing that cnns might not be optimal 
architecture for computer vision anymore. but how do vision transformer work exactly, and
what benefits and drawbacks do they offer in contrast to cnns? we will answer these questions by
implementing a vision transformer ourselves and train it on the popular, small dataset
cifar10. we will compare these results to the convolutional architectures of t5
